Hi there !

This is my work at NUSRI (NUS Suzhou Research Institute) from 2022.9-2023.10, approximately 13 months.

Overall, I have built an end-to-end system integrating visual information and dynamic sensing is developed for recognition of American Sign Language(ASL) gestures.

The project was supervised by Prof. Chengkuo Lee and Dr. Zixuan Zhang at NUS.

You could view the project's 1) Overall diagram  2) Details of AI architecture of Gesture Recognition 3) Demo video at https://jasonshen-sh.github.io/specifics2.html.

This project is now undergoing further improvment by other members at NUS, and is planned for publications next year. Stay tuned !
